# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Task Implementation

- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub-task until you ask the user for permission and they say “Yes” or “Y”
- **Completion protocol:**
    - When you finish a **sub-task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing ‘[ ]’ to ‘[x]’
    - If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now ‘[x]’, also mark the **parent task** as completed
- Stop after each sub-task and wait for the user’s go-ahead

## Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as your work:**
    1. Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (‘[x]’) per the protocol above
    2. Add new tasks as they emerge

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
    1. List every file created or modified
    2. Give each file a one-line description of its purpose

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
    1. Mark each finished **sub-task** ‘[x]’
    2. Mark the **parent task** ‘[x]’ once **all** its subtasks are ‘[x]’
    3. Add newly discovered tasks
    4. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up-to-date
    5. Before starting work, check which sub-task is next
    6. After implementing a sub-task, update the file and then pause for user approval
