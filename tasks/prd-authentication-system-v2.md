# Product Requirements Document: Authentication System V2

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the development of a secure, user-friendly authentication system for our language learning application. The system will enable users to create accounts, log in securely, and access personalized learning features. The primary goal is to provide a frictionless authentication experience while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards, allowing users to safely store their learning progress and access personalized content.

## Goals

1. Achieve a 95%+ registration completion rate (improved from previous 90% target)
2. Maintain a 98%+ successful login rate for valid credentials (improved from previous 95% target)
3. Reduce authentication-related support tickets by 50% compared to industry average
4. Achieve sub-2-second response times for all authentication operations
5. Maintain zero critical security vulnerabilities
6. Achieve 100% WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
7. Support seamless integration with future language learning features

## User Stories

1. **New User Registration**
   - As a new user, I want to create an account with my email and password so that I can start my language learning journey and save my progress
   - As a new user, I want clear feedback about password requirements so that I can create a secure account on my first try
   - As a new user, I want to know my registration status so that I can ensure my account is properly set up

2. **Returning User Login**
   - As a returning user, I want to sign in quickly with my existing credentials so that I can continue my language learning journey
   - As a returning user, I want to stay logged in across sessions so that I don't have to re-enter my credentials frequently
   - As a returning user, I want to be notified of suspicious login attempts so that I can maintain account security

3. **Password Recovery**
   - As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it using my email so that I can regain access to my account
   - As a user resetting my password, I want clear instructions about the reset process so that I can complete it successfully
   - As a user, I want to know when my password has been successfully changed so that I can be confident in my account security

4. **Session Management**
   - As a user, I want my login session to persist appropriately so that I don't have to re-authenticate unnecessarily
   - As a user, I want to be warned before my session expires so that I can save my work
   - As a user, I want to be able to log out from any device so that I can maintain account security

2. Two-factor authentication (2FA)
3. Magic link authentication
4. Enterprise SSO capabilities
5. User role management or permissions
