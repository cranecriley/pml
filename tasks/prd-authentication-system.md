# Product Requirements Document: Authentication System

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the development of a secure authentication system for our language learning application. The feature will enable users to create accounts, log in securely, and access platform features. The primary goal is to provide a simple, reliable authentication flow that allows users to safely store their learning progress and access personalized content.

## Goals

1. Enable secure user registration with email and password
2. Provide reliable login functionality for returning users
3. Implement password reset capability for account recovery
4. Achieve a 90%+ registration completion rate
5. Maintain a 95%+ successful login rate for valid credentials
6. Integrate seamlessly with Supabase Auth infrastructure

## User Stories

1. **New User Registration**
   - As a new user, I want to create an account with my email and password so that I can access the language learning platform and save my progress.

2. **Returning User Login**
   - As a returning user, I want to sign in quickly with my existing credentials so that I can continue my language learning journey.

3. **Password Recovery**
   - As a user who forgot my password, I want to reset it using my email so that I can regain access to my account.

4. **Secure Session Management**
   - As a user, I want my login session to persist appropriately so that I don't have to re-authenticate unnecessarily while maintaining security.

## Functional Requirements

1. The system must allow users to register with a valid email address and password.
2. The system must validate email format during registration.
3. The system must enforce password requirements (minimum 8 characters).
4. The system must send email verification to new users upon registration.
5. The system must prevent registration with duplicate email addresses.
6. The system must allow users to log in with their email and password.
7. The system must display appropriate error messages for invalid login credentials.
8. The system must redirect new users to a welcome/dashboard page after successful registration.
9. The system must redirect returning users directly to the main dashboard after login.
10. The system must provide a "Forgot Password" link on the login page.
11. The system must send password reset emails when users request them.
12. The system must allow users to set a new password through the reset link.
13. The system must maintain user sessions securely using Supabase Auth.
14. The system must provide a logout functionality.
15. The system must handle and display network errors gracefully.
16. The system must automatically log out users after 24 hours of inactivity.
17. The system must rate limit failed login attempts (max 5 attempts per email within 15 minutes).
18. The system must expire password reset links after 1 hour.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. Social login integration (Google, Facebook, Apple)
2. Two-factor authentication (2FA)
3. Magic link authentication
4. Enterprise SSO capabilities
5. User role management or permissions
6. Advanced security features beyond standard authentication
7. Account deletion functionality
8. Profile management during registration
9. Age verification beyond stating 18+ requirement

## Design Considerations

- Login and registration forms should be clean and accessible
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Loading states should be visible during authentication processes
- Forms should be responsive across desktop and mobile devices
- Success/error feedback should be immediate and clear
- Password fields should have show/hide toggle functionality

## Technical Considerations

- Integration with Supabase Auth for backend authentication services
- Built using React/TypeScript/Vite technology stack
- Email validation should use standard HTML5 validation plus custom logic
- Password strength validation on the frontend (minimum 8 characters)
- Secure session token management through Supabase
- Email templates for verification and password reset handled by Supabase
- Error handling for network timeouts and service unavailability
- User sessions should remain active for 24 hours before requiring re-authentication
- Implement rate limiting: maximum 5 failed login attempts per email address within 15 minutes
- Password reset links expire after 1 hour for security

## Success Metrics

1. **Registration Completion Rate**: 90%+ of users who start registration complete it successfully
2. **Login Success Rate**: 95%+ of login attempts with valid credentials succeed
3. **Password Reset Success Rate**: 90%+ of password reset requests result in successful password changes
4. **User Retention**: Track if users return to log in after initial registration
5. **Error Rate**: Less than 5% of authentication attempts result in system errors
