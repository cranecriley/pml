## Daily Git Commands

### Starting Testing Phase
- git checkout develop
- git pull origin develop
- git checkout -b testing/authentication-system

### After Each Sub-task Completion
- git add .
- git commit -m "auth-testing: Task [X.X]: [description]"

### Completing Testing Phase
**Test before merging (required)**
- npm run build && npm run preview
**Merge to develop**
- git checkout develop
- git pull origin develop
- git merge testing/authentication-system
- git push origin develop
- git branch -d testing/authentication-system
**Tag if this completes testing milestone**
- git tag v1.x.x-tested && git push origin --tags

## Git Best Practices
- Never commit directly to main branch
- Always test before merging
- Use descriptive commit messages with "auth-testing:" prefix
- Keep testing branches focused and short-lived
- Tag releases when testing milestones are complete
