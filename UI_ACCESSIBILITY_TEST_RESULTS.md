### ❌ **FAILED Tests**  
_(Tests where features were not accessible through UI)_

None identified - all authentication features appear to be accessible through UI navigation.

### ⚠️ **ISSUES FOUND**
_(UI accessibility issues that need fixing)_

#### **Minor Issues (Non-Critical)**:
1. **Profile Settings**: Multiple profile/settings links are placeholder (`href="#"`) - not functional (expected - profile features not yet implemented)
2. **Lessons/Progress**: Navigation links are placeholders - not functional (expected - learning features not yet implemented)
3. **404 Page**: Simple 404 page could be enhanced with better navigation options

#### **All Navigation Verified**:
- ✅ All authentication features are accessible through UI navigation
- ✅ No direct URL typing required for any authentication functionality
- ✅ Complete navigation flows between all auth pages work correctly

### 📝 **RECOMMENDATIONS**
_(Suggested improvements for UI accessibility)_

#### **Immediate Enhancements**:
1. **Add "Back to Login" links** in registration and password reset forms for better navigation flow
2. **Profile Settings Implementation**: Convert placeholder links to functional routes when profile features are built
3. **Mobile Navigation Enhancement**: Ensure all mobile navigation states work correctly
4. **Keyboard Navigation**: Verify all dropdowns and menus work with keyboard navigation

#### **Future Considerations**:
1. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Add breadcrumbs for complex auth flows
2. **Progress Indicators**: Show users where they are in multi-step auth processes
3. **Quick Actions**: Add more quick access points for common tasks
