# Authentication System Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for the authentication system we built together.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Run the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Access the automated test suite**: Visit `http://localhost:5173/test`
3. **Manual testing**: Follow the detailed scenarios below

## üß™ Automated Test Suite

Visit `/test` route to run the automated test suite that covers:

- **UI Component Tests**: Form rendering, validation, loading states
- **Authentication Flow Tests**: Registration, login, password reset
- **Error Handling Tests**: Network errors, rate limiting, user-friendly messages
- **Route Protection Tests**: Access control and redirects
- **Security & Performance Tests**: Rate limiting, data masking, performance

**Expected Results:**
- **Without Supabase**: UI and error handling tests should pass; auth tests will show expected failures
- **With Supabase**: All tests should pass with real authentication

## üîß Testing with Supabase

### Setup Required:
1. Create Supabase project at https://supabase.com
2. Get project URL and anon key from dashboard
3. Create `.env.local` file:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```
4. Configure email templates in Supabase dashboard
5. Restart dev server

### With Supabase Connected:
- All authentication flows work with real emails
- Email verification and password reset emails sent
- Real user accounts created and managed
- Session management fully functional

### Without Supabase (Mock Testing):
- UI components and validation work perfectly
- Error handling can be tested with simulated errors
- Rate limiting and client-side logic functional
- Routing and state management testable

## üêõ Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid URL" or Supabase Errors
**Solution**: Check environment variables are set correctly

### Issue: No Confirmation Email
**Solution**: Configure Supabase email templates and SMTP settings

### Issue: Rate Limiting Not Working
**Solution**: Clear localStorage or use different email addresses

### Issue: Session Not Persisting
**Solution**: Check browser settings allow localStorage

### Issue: Redirect Loops
**Solution**: Check route protection logic and authentication state

## ‚úÖ Test Completion Checklist

## üéØ Next Steps

After testing confirms the authentication system works correctly:
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Configure production Supabase settings
3. Set up monitoring and analytics
4. Begin building core language learning features
5. Integrate user progress tracking

The authentication foundation is now solid and ready for your language learning application!
